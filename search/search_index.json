Components Components are Laminas modules that deliver low-level functionality; examples include the various Laminas components themselves. These require the following: A Module class in the package namespace. An extra.laminas.component entry listing the package namespace in your composer.json . \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"component\": \"Some\\\\Component\" } } You may also specify multiple components as an array: \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"component\": [ \"Some\\\\Component\", \"Other\\\\Component\" ] } } Your application will need to have one or more of the following configuration files, from which you will be prompted to choose which one in which to inject the component: config/application.config.php (vanilla Laminas application) config/modules.config.php ( Laminas API Tools application) config/development.config.php.dist and config/development.config.php (applications using laminas-development-mode ) Components are added at the top of the application's list of modules. Modules Laminas modules typically deliver functionality around the laminas-mvc workflow, including MVC event listeners, controllers, etc. To enable the installer workflow, they require the following: A Module class in the package namespace. An extra.laminas.module entry listing the package namespace in your composer.json . \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"module\": \"Some\\\\Component\" } } You may also specify multiple modules as an array: \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"module\": [ \"Some\\\\Component\", \"Other\\\\Component\" ] } } Your application will need to have one or more of the following configuration files, from which you will be prompted to choose which one in which to inject the module: config/application.config.php (vanilla Laminas application) config/modules.config.php ( Laminas API Tools application) config/development.config.php.dist and config/development.config.php (applications using laminas-development-mode ) Modules are added at the bottom of the application's list of modules. Config Providers Configuration providers work with mezzio-config-manager and laminas-config-aggregator , which provides generic functionality for aggregating and merging application configuration. Packages that provide configuration will provide an invokable class that returns configuration for the package. To enable the installer workflow, you will need: A configuration provider class. This is a class with no constructor arguments defining an __invoke() method returning a configuration array. namespace Some\\Component; class ConfigProvider { public function __invoke() { return [ /* ... */ ]; } } An extra.laminas.config-provider entry listing the configuration provider class in your composer.json . \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"config-provider\": \"Some\\\\Component\\\\ConfigProvider\" } } You may also specify multiple configuration providers as an array: \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"config-provider\": [ \"Some\\\\Component\\\\ConfigProvider\", \"Some\\\\Component\\\\PluginConfigProvider\" ] } } Your application will need to define a config/config.php file, and that file will need to have a line that instantiates either a Mezzio\\ConfigManager\\ConfigManager instance (deprecated) or Laminas\\ConfigAggregator\\ConfigAggregator instance. Configuration providers are added at the top of the ConfigManager / ConfigAggregator provider array. Marking packages to auto-install At the root package level, you can indicate that certain packages that supply config providers and/or modules should automatically inject configuration, instead of prompting for installation, via the component-auto-installs setting. This value should be an array of package names. { \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"component-auto-installs\": [ \"mezzio/mezzio\", \"mezzio/mezzio-helper\", \"mezzio/mezzio-fastrouterouter\", \"mezzio/mezzio-platesrenderer\" ] } } } This setting only works in the root package. Excluding Packages from Being Auto-Installed At the root package level, you can also indicate that certain packages that supply config providers and/or modules should NOT automatically inject configuration, instead of prompting for installation, via the component-ignore-list setting. This value should be an array of package names. \"extra\": { \"laminas\": { \"component-ignore-list\": [ \"laminas/laminas-db\" ] } } This setting only works in the root package. Why? When preparing laminas-mvc's version 3 release, we wanted to reduce the number of components required by the package. To do so, we moved integration code, such as factories, plugin managers, and event listeners into the components they consumed. This had a side effect: the components were no longer wired automatically. To provide service and event wiring, we added Module classes (and configuration providers) to all Laminas components. This exposed a new problem, however: how could we ensure that those components are added to the application module list as you add them to your application? This package provides the answer to that problem. As soon as you add this package to your application, whenever you add a component or module that exposes itself as such, the plugin will prompt you, asking where you want to inject it. When are multiple items required? As noted under each of the component, module, and config-provider sections, you can optionally specify an array of items. When would you do this? The primary reason is for metapackages . Composer does not trigger either post-package-install or post-package-uninstall events for packages defined as metapackage requirements. As such, you would define the metadata for such packages in the metapackage as well, to ensure that the component installer can update the configuration accordingly. The other use case is to allow specifying multiple configuration providers from the same package. As an example, you might define default configuration, plus configuration for plugins; specifying these as separate configuration providers allows the consumer to choose if they want both enabled in their application. Removing individual packages When removing individual packages that were originally installed via a metapackage, the component installer will not trigger . As such, you will need to manually remove such packages from your configuration. Additionally, a later update may actually re-install the package, as it's a requirement of the metapackage. As such, it's typically safer to: Remove the metapackage Individually install the packages from the metapackage that you wish to keep.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#basic-usage","text":"","title":"Basic Usage"},{"location":"#installation","text":"$ composer require --dev laminas/laminas-component-installer","title":"Installation"},{"location":"#installable-packages","text":"How do you define a package for which laminas-component-installer will install configuration?","title":"Installable Packages"},{"location":"#marking-packages-to-auto-install","text":"At the root package level, you can indicate that certain packages that supply config providers and/or modules should automatically inject configuration, instead of prompting for installation, via the component-auto-installs setting.
